Ok so this is my first time to creat a git-hub repository.
If all goes well I will look first to fork a kernel with resources from another git and look to build somethign for the Galaxy Note2
If this is successful I hope in the long term to try and add functions that are missing for the Japanese variant[SC-02E/SGH-N025].
